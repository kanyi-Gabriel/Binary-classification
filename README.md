#  Binary Classification with PyTorch

This project is a **binary image classification** task where the goal is to distinguish between **antelope images** and **blank (empty) images**. The implementation uses **PyTorch** and **Python**, with the dataset stored in a local directory structure.

The dataset is organized as follows:
```

data_binary/
â”‚â”€â”€ data/
    â”œâ”€â”€ antelope/   # Contains images of antelopes
    â”œâ”€â”€ blanks/     # Contains blank/empty images
